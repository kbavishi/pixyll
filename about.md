As of Fall '16, I'm a Masters student at the *University of Wisconsin-Madison*.

Before that, I worked for 4 years at [Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com/en/) on L2 protocols, high availability infrastructure and applications for datacenter switches. Prior to that, I was an undergraduate
at [BITS Pilani](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/). 

I'm broadly interested in the areas of computer networks and distributed systems. Check out my projects page for more info.

If not working at my laptop, you will most likely find me binge watching on Netflix or reading a book.

[Here](/assets/Karan-Bavishi-Resume-Aug-2016.pdf) is my short resume.
